Here is a list of things that I have created. Some are personal projects and others are things that I have created while working at [Royal Jay](http://royaljay.com), [BasicSafe](http://basicsafe.us) (previous employer) and [Pinnpointe](http://www.pinnpointe.com/)(previous previous employer).

### Longest Streak

[Longest Streak](http://longeststreak.net) is a Ruby on Rails application hosted on DigitalOcean that helps answer the question, "Who has the longest streak on GitHub?". Currently the app has streak information of over 6.5 Million users.

### Dailyweight

[Dailyweight](https://dailyweight.herokuapp.com/) is Ruby on Rails application hosted on Heroku. It helps you lose weight by keeping track of how much you weigh each day. I've lost over 15 pounds and my wife has lost over 35 pounds using this app.

### Iris Maps

A Sinatra powered web application written in Ruby with a MSSQL backend. Iris Maps is a tool created to monitor each of our retail reps as the visit grocery stores. Each retail rep answers specific questions while using an iPad and the results get stored in our database. Iris Maps reads from that database so that we can see which stores are being visisted and how often. Iris Maps also calculates how long each retail rep was inside of a store and the travel time between stores. This allows us to optimise routes and detect problematic stores.

### Cube API
This is my latest creation at Pinnpointe and it allows us to query our data cubes that are stored in analysis services so that we can build custom dashboards and access the data through our other internal apps. Cube API is written in C# and uses the ASP.NET MVC 4 Framework.

***

### Pinnports

Pinnports is a custom framework I built in C# and VBA for pulling in data from Olap cubes, creating charts, and building Powerpoint presentations.

Pinnports is used on a daily bases by our team of analysts across the country and completely changed the way we do business with our clients.

### LDS Archive

LDS Archive is my first iOS application created to make reading Genearal Conference talks published before 1971 an enjoyable experience. These articles can now be read in an easy to read format on your mobile device compared to the difficuled scanned images these articles were originally published in.

I built this app as my first project to learn Objective-C and the Cocoa Touch framework. The app is not in the app store due to copyright issues since I do not own any of the content.

Creating this app I learned about:

+ Moving between views
+ UITableViews
+ UIWebViews
+ Storing Data in plists
+ XCode

### Toast App
An iOS app for generating before and after pics.

I got sick of seeing some poorly created before and after pictures and thought I could make a simple tool for the iPhone that would create clean and eligent before and after pics everytime.

The app works by selecting two images either from your camera roll or by taking a picture from within the app. You then have an option to use the default 'Before' and 'After' text or you can customize the left and right side of the image to say anything you want. After you hit the save button the two images are saved as a single image in your iPhone camera roll.

See the screen shot below of an example before and after image Toasted with the Toast app:
